IronApps - Apps recommendation system
=====================================

The excercise was done on centOS (linux). 
*** I'm assuming here that the machine has nodejs installed ***

To build the app:
- extract the files to an empty directory
- run "cd apps"
- run "sh build.sh"

In the end, the script will show a message - "UI is avaliable on localhost:9898/apps"
